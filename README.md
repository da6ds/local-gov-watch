# Local Gov Watch

**Making local government accessible to everyone.**

Local Gov Watch empowers civic engagement by removing the barriers between residents and their local government. We aggregate meeting minutes, agendas, votes, and legislation from multiple municipalities into one centralized, searchable platform—so anyone can stay informed and participate in the decisions that shape their community.

## Why This Matters

Local government decisions affect daily life more directly than state or federal policy—zoning, housing, public safety, parks, schools, transit. But staying informed is unreasonably hard. Information is scattered across dozens of municipal websites, each with different formats, update schedules, and search capabilities.

**The result:** Only those with time and resources can effectively engage. Local Gov Watch changes that.

## Who It’s For

### Residents & Community Members

Stay informed about decisions affecting your neighborhood without spending hours on government websites. Follow topics you care about across your city, county, and neighboring jurisdictions.

### Policy Advocates & Nonprofits

Track legislation and policy decisions across multiple jurisdictions. Build cases with historical context. Never miss a relevant meeting again.

### Government Workers

Monitor what neighboring and related jurisdictions are doing. Research how other municipalities have handled similar issues. Stay coordinated across agencies.

### Professionals (Developers, Law Firms, Consultants)

Monitor municipal legislation that affects your projects. Track zoning changes, permit processes, and regulatory updates across your coverage area.

## Design Principles

- **Accessibility first** - If it’s not easy to use, it doesn’t serve the mission
- **Consistency** - Standardized patterns so users can focus on content, not interface
- **Location context** - Every item displays its jurisdiction clearly
- **Performance** - Fast load times because people’s time matters
